# Extensibility

The Agent Client Protocol provides built-in extension mechanisms that allow implementations to add custom functionality while maintaining compatibility with the core protocol. These mechanisms ensure that Agents and Clients can innovate without breaking interoperability.

## The `_meta` Field

All types in the protocol include a `_meta` field with type `{ [key: string]: unknown }` that implementations can use to attach custom information. This includes requests, responses, notifications, and even nested types like content blocks, tool calls, plan entries, and capability objects.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "session/prompt",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "prompt": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Hello, world!"
      }
    ],
    "_meta": {
      "traceparent": "00-80e1afed08e019fc1110464cfa66635c-7a085853722dc6d2-01",
      "zed.dev/debugMode": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Reserved Keys

Clients may propagate fields to the agent for correlation purposes, such as `requestId`. The following root-level keys in `_meta` **SHOULD** be reserved for [W3C trace context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) to guarantee interop with existing MCP implementations and OpenTelemetry tooling:

- `traceparent`
- `tracestate`
- `baggage`

### Important Restriction

Implementations **MUST NOT** add any custom fields at the root of a type that's part of the specification. All possible names are reserved for future protocol versions.

## Extension Methods

The protocol reserves any method name starting with an underscore (`_`) for custom extensions. This allows implementations to add new functionality without the risk of conflicting with future protocol versions.

Extension methods follow standard [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) semantics:

- **Requests** - Include an `id` field and expect a response
- **Notifications** - Omit the `id` field and are one-way

### Custom Requests

In addition to the requests specified by the protocol, implementations **MAY** expose and call custom JSON-RPC requests as long as their name starts with an underscore (`_`).

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "_zed.dev/workspace/buffers",
  "params": {
    "language": "rust"
  }
}
```

Upon receiving a custom request, implementations **MUST** respond accordingly with the provided `id`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "buffers": [
      { "id": 0, "path": "/home/user/project/src/main.rs" },
      { "id": 1, "path": "/home/user/project/src/editor.rs" }
    ]
  }
}
```

If the receiving end doesn't recognize the custom method name, it should respond with the standard "Method not found" error:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "Method not found"
  }
}
```

To avoid such cases, extensions **SHOULD** advertise their custom capabilities so that callers can check their availability first and adapt their behavior or interface accordingly.

### Custom Notifications

Custom notifications are regular JSON-RPC notifications that start with an underscore (`_`). Like all notifications, they omit the `id` field:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "_zed.dev/file_opened",
  "params": {
    "path": "/home/user/project/src/editor.rs"
  }
}
```

Unlike with custom requests, implementations **SHOULD** ignore unrecognized notifications.

## Advertising Custom Capabilities

Implementations **SHOULD** use the `_meta` field in capability objects to advertise support for extensions and their methods:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": 1,
    "agentCapabilities": {
      "loadSession": true,
      "_meta": {
        "zed.dev": {
          "workspace": true,
          "fileNotifications": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This allows implementations to negotiate custom features during initialization without breaking compatibility with standard Clients and Agents.

## Naming Conventions

When creating extensions, use a namespace to avoid conflicts:

- **Company/product namespace**: `zed.dev/featureName`
- **Project namespace**: `myproject/customMethod`

## Best Practices

### For Extension Authors

1. **Use meaningful names** - Extensions should have clear, descriptive names
2. **Document thoroughly** - Provide documentation for custom methods and their parameters
3. **Version your extensions** - Consider versioning if your extension may evolve
4. **Fail gracefully** - Handle cases where the peer doesn't support your extension
5. **Advertise capabilities** - Always advertise custom capabilities during initialization

### For Implementations

1. **Ignore unknown notifications** - Don't error on unrecognized notifications
2. **Return proper errors** - Return "Method not found" for unknown requests
3. **Check capabilities first** - Don't call extension methods without checking support
4. **Preserve _meta fields** - Pass through _meta fields when forwarding messages
5. **Use namespaces** - Avoid collisions with other implementations

## Example: Custom Analytics Extension

### Advertising the Capability

Agent advertises analytics support:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": 1,
    "agentCapabilities": {
      "loadSession": true,
      "_meta": {
        "example.com/analytics": {
          "version": "1.0",
          "events": ["tool_execution", "model_call"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Sending Analytics Events

Client sends analytics notifications:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "_example.com/analytics/event",
  "params": {
    "event": "user_action",
    "data": {
      "action": "accepted_suggestion",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Querying Analytics

Client requests analytics data:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 42,
  "method": "_example.com/analytics/summary",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "period": "current_session"
  }
}
```
